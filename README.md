# ragArticleModel
This machine learning model takes in an article as input and is able to answer questions based of the context provided from the articles by using Retrieval Augmented Generation. 

__Overview__


ragArticleModel is a machine learning model designed to answer questions based on the content of an input article. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the model efficiently combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation. By processing the provided article, it generates relevant and contextually accurate responses to user queries.

__Features__


Contextual Understanding: The model reads and understands the input article, enabling it to provide precise answers based on the information contained within the article.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses RAG to enhance the response generation process by retrieving relevant information from the article and using it to generate well-informed answers.
Flexible Input: Can process a wide variety of article types and topics, making it adaptable to multiple domains.
